        <p class="project-info">
          I started by doing some benchmarking and looked at other conference
          sites in the tech space to see what functionality they were offering
          to users. I analyzed interactions, UI elements, typography and
          language of the sites. They all had some features in common that also
          aligned with what we were trying to tackle:<br /><br />

        <p class="project-info">
          As a group we went through each of our problem statements and
          discussed how each feature from the benchmark analysis could solve our
          own problems. I came up with a simple site map to visualize the bones
          of our site and use it as a starting point for discussion about the
          functionality and later the design of each feature.

          Once we had a well-defined idea of what we were building, it was time
          for the fun part - designing the interactions and interface. To design
          the site, I got some guidelines from the branding consultant who the
          Rails Foundation was working with regarding the colour pallet, fonts
          and some specific design aspects to stay on brand!<br />
          Beginning with a wireframe I started to shape the initial
          visualization of our website's appearance and functionality. During
          the design phase, I incorporated our solutions, addressing the

          more in-depth ideation process. We began by creating a similar map
          with all of the features the app should have and what each one needed
          to do.

          make updates and re-test with the users. Some of the design-related

        <h2 class="secondary-heading">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="project-info pad-b-sm">
          Reflecting on this project, I particularly enjoyed the app testing
          step, being a small team it was possible to implement changes very
          fast and present updated versions to test users almost live. This was
          such a valuable step in the process and really helped us to build a
          great user-centered product that I hope the Ruby Foundation will
          re-use for future conferences. <br/ > I do recognize even more areas
          for potential enhancement, particularly in the agenda layout design. I
          put together alternative agenda lay-outs, where events that are
          running simultaneously at different locations are displayed in one
          view. This way the user has better visibility and can compare and
          choose what they want to attend.

          Finally, I really enjoyed working on this project and will carry many
          valuable lessons into my future work. The cherry on top was getting to
          attend the conference, meeting the wider Ruby community and seeing
          them all interact with software that I helped to build! üéâ
