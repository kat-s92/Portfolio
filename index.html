          <h1>TL;DR</h1>
          <h2>Definitely too long to read but here for anyone who gives me the time of day, I appreciate you...</h2>
          <div class="vertical-scroll-about">
          <p>My journey to the world of UX design began a while back when I just started working in recruiting operations. On a daily basis, I was seeing engineers, product managers and designers getting hired and I had no idea what they did or how they came about to be such desirable talent in the industry. I wondered what they studied and how smart they must be to have recruiters chase after them like that! I began to dig further and soon realised that their qualifications were not all that different to mine! Go figure‚Ä¶ <br/>

            I began my experimentation cautiously by dipping a toe into a coding workshop where I built my first simple webpage. With every line of code I wrote, I continued to be amazed at what I was doing. I took a further workshop which started to get more complicated, concepts of usability and colour schemes began to emerge and this is where it got even more interesting for me. I realised that I was more interested in how the user would interact with my new creation and whether it was a pleasant experience for them. I also really enjoyed playing around with colours, fonts and button sizes.

            <br/> This is how I arrived at UX design - a perfect merge of human psychology, technology and design.<i class="fa-solid fa-wand-magic-sparkles fa-beat" style="padding-left:6px"></i> <br/> I completed an intensive UX Diploma training, which provided me with a solid foundation in user research, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing. I really fell in love with UX and  immersed myself in it, I practiced my Figma skills and did my own pet project research,  I read books, I listened to podcasts and followed designers on social media.

            <br/> However, my learning did not stop there. Recognizing the importance of understanding the technical aspects of the entire product creation process, I also successfully completed a rigorous coding bootcamp. This experience has been incredibly insightful and valuable. I got to see first hand exactly how a UX team would fit into the product creation process from idea generation all the way to deployment. I got to tackle real-life problems and come up with my own solutions as well as work within a UX/Dev union. I played the role of UX designer and front-end developer but the real cherry on top was that I led our small team of three to create a product that I myself pitched the idea for.

            <br/>To draw a conclusion to this very long spiel, I would like to say that the more work I do in UX design and research, the more I want to deepen my knowledge and skills! Maybe a cliche but my goal is to create smooth, friendly user experiences through purposeful and intuitive designs that solve real human problems. Don't hesitate to reach out and let's create together!
